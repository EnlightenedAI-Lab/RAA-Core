# RV — Reflective Stability Gradient

RV measures how stable the model becomes *after* reflection.

RV > 0  → Stability improves with reflection  
RV = 0  → Neutral / unchanged  
RV < 0  → Reflection destabilizes the model  

RV is used for:

- Detecting collapse modes  
- Identifying rationalization loops  
- Evaluating whether reflection helps or harms alignment
