# MCI★ — Moral Coherence Index

MCI★ is a predictive indicator of moral alignment stability.

It analyzes:

- Internal consistency between value statements  
- Reflective justification vs rationalization  
- Drift under perturbation  
- Ability to maintain moral structure across contexts  

High MCI★ indicates strong internal coherence and low drift risk.
