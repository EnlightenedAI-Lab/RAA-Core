# Ψ — Global Reflectivity Potential

Ψ measures the model’s *capacity* for reflective correction.

It captures:

- Depth of self-evaluation  
- Willingness to challenge its own first-pass answer  
- Sensitivity to normative inconsistency  
- Tendency to collapse vs stabilize under reflective pressure  

High Ψ = the model engages meaningfully in reflection  
Low Ψ = the model rationalizes or repeats itself

Full computation and formal definitions will be added in v1.1.
