# Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)

The RDL is the mathematical core of RAA.

It formalizes the relationship between:

- Forward trajectory (the model’s first reasoning pass)
- Reflective trajectory (the model critiquing or revising its own reasoning)

By comparing these dual trajectories, the RDL extracts:

- Coherence metrics (agreement, justification, stability)
- Drift indicators (perturbational instability, collapse patterns)
- Reflective signatures (rationalization vs genuine correction)
- Ψ — Global reflectivity potential
- RV — Gradient of reflective stability
- MCI★ — Moral Coherence Index (predictive)

Full derivations and proofs will be added here.
