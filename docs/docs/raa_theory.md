# RAA Theory

This document presents the formal theoretical foundations of the Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA).  
It expands on the core principle:

> **Internal reasoning stability is the true measure of alignment.**

Topics included in this section:

- Mathematical structure of internal trajectories  
- Stability under perturbation  
- Relationship to the Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)  
- Predictive alignment indicators (Ψ, R∇, MCI★)  
- Failure modes and drift signatures  
- Mathematical framing of reflective correction  

More formal content will be added as the theory section is developed.
